Our Arrays workshop goes into this deeper, and our [Academy](https://cloud.tiledb.com/academy/structure/arrays/index.html) has a whole section on them. At a high level,  TileDB is architected around multi-dimensional arrays and, therefore, the array is a first-class citizen in TileDB. TileDB supports both dense and sparse arrays. In a dense array, each element (called a \u201ccell\u201d) has a value that is materialized on storage. In a sparse array, the majority of cells are empty and, therefore, TileDB does not materialize them on storage. These two array types offer interesting tradeoffs, which is a topic we will dive into deeper in a different lab. The decision on whether to model your data with a dense or sparse array depends on the application, and it can greatly affect performance. We can store all sorts of data in arrays. This concept is something we will cover in a different workshop, but you can also explore [Academy's Performance Section](https://cloud.tiledb.com/academy/structure/arrays/tutorials/performance/index.html) to learn more! \n### Section Goals\nIn this section, we will create both dense and sparse arrays, ingest files, and store data in a table using TileDB.

While single-cell genomics data is the most common use case, TileDB-SOMA is equally useful for other types of omics data as well, such as bulk RNA-seq. \n#### VCF\nTileDB was first used to build a variant store system in 2015, as part of a collaboration between Intel Labs, Intel Health and Life Sciences, MIT and the Broad Institute. The resulting software, GenomicsDB, became part of Broad\u2019s GATK 4.0. TileDB-VCF is an evolution of that work, built on an improved and always up-to-date version of the open-source TileDB array engine, incorporating new algorithms, features, and optimizations. TileDB-VCF has extended security, management, scalable compute, and visualization features on TileDB Cloud.\n#### Imaging\nTileDB provides support for importing, visualizing, analyzing, and exporting multi-resolution whole-slide microscopy images. This can be done through integrated ingestion, viewer, data management, access control, and computation for bioimaging datasets within the TileDB user interface. As well as, Python APIs for ingesting images to TileDB BioImage arrays, slicing them with NumPy array semantics, or reading them via an OpenSlide Python-compatible API.
